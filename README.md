# wintun

Safe rust idiomatic bindings for the Wintun C library: <https://wintun.net>

All features of the Wintun library are wrapped using pure rust types and functions to make
usage feel ergonomic.

## Usage

Add a dependency on this library to your `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
wintun = "0.1"
```

Inside your code load the wintun.dll signed driver file, downloaded from <https://wintun.net>

Then either call [`Adapter::create`] or [`Adapter::open`] to obtain a wintun
adapter. Start a session with [`Adapter::start_session`].

## Example
```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

//Must be run as Administrator because we create network adapters
fn main() {
    //Load the wintun dll file so that we can call the underlying C functions
    //Unsafe because we are loading an arbitrary dll file
    let wintun = unsafe { wintun::load_from_path("path/to/wintun.dll") }.expect("Failed to load wintun dll");
    //Try to open an adapter from the given pool with the name "Demo"
    let adapter = match wintun::Adapter::open(&wintun, "Example", "Demo") {
        Ok(a) => a,
        Err(_) =>
            //If loading failed (most likely it didn't exist), create a new one
            wintun::Adapter::create(&wintun, "Example", "Demo", None).expect("Failed to create wintun adapter!").adapter,
    };
    //Specify the size of the ring buffer the wintun driver should use.
    let session = Arc::new(adapter.start_session(wintun::MAX_RING_CAPACITY).unwrap());

    //Get a 20 byte packet from the ring buffer
    let mut packet = session.allocate_send_packet(20).unwrap();
    let bytes: &mut [u8] = packet.bytes_mut();
    //Write IPV4 version and header length
    bytes[0] = 0x40;

    //Finish writing IP header
    bytes[9] = 0x69;
    bytes[10] = 0x04;
    bytes[11] = 0x20;
    //...

    //Send the packet to wintun virtual adapter for processing by the system
    session.send_packet(packet);

    //Stop any readers blocking for data on other threads
    //Only needed when a blocking reader is preventing shutdown Ie. it holds an Arc to the
    //session, blocking it from being dropped
    session.shutdown();

    //the session is stopped on drop
    //drop(session);

    //Delete the adapter when finished.
    //Argument is to force close sessions
    adapter.delete(false).unwrap();
    //drop(adapter)
    //And the adapter closes its resources when dropped
}

```

See `examples/wireguard.rs` for a more complete example that writes received packets to a pcap
file.

## Features

- `panic_on_unsent_packets`: Panics if a send packet is dropped without being sent. Useful for
debugging packet issues because unsent packets that are dropped without being sent hold up
wintun's internal ring buffer.

## TODO:
- Add async support
Requires hooking into a windows specific reactor and registering read interest on wintun's read
handle. Asyncify other slow operations via tokio::spawn_blocking. As always, PR's are welcome!
